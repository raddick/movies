    "# The Bechdel Test: is it stupider than the stupid test?\n",
    "## No. It measures something meaningful, even if no one can agree on exactly what.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Internet has been afire recently about the recent National Review article by Kyle Smith, <a href='http://www.nationalreview.com/article/449340/bechdel-test-feminist-litmus-test-movies-useless-political-correctness'>If You Like Art, Don’t Take the Bechdel Test</a>. Smith argues that the Bechdel test is nothing more than a political-correctness litmus test, useless for saying anything meaningful about movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have already been many interesting responses to the piece, like <a href='http://www.salon.com/2017/07/11/national-review-bechdel-test/'>this one from Salon</a> and <a href='http://ew.com/movies/2017/07/10/kyle-smith-slammed-bechdel-test-takedown/'>this one from Entertainment Weekly</a>. But what can we learn from actually looking at the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bechdel test's origin lies in 1985 comic by <a href='http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/'>Alison Bechdel</a>, author of the print and online comic strip <a href='http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/strip-archive-by-number'>Dykes to Watch Out For</a>. In that particular comic, called <a href='http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Rule-cleaned-up.jpg'>The Rule</a>, one female character explains to another a rule she uses to decide what movie to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>It has to have at least two women in it, who...</li>\n",
    "<li>talk to each other...</li>\n",
    "<li>about something other than a man.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "The implication was clear: such a test seems like an absurdly low bar, but shockingly few well-known films actually pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test stayed there, and unnammed, until the early 2000s. At that time, it started to be discussed in film schools and on movie blogs, and gained the name of its initial author. In 2013, a chain of theaters in Sweden started <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/06/swedish-cinemas-bechdel-test-films-gender-bias'>issuing ratings indicating whether or not their movies passed the Bechdel test</a>. Bechdel herself says that <a href='http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/testy'>she feels some ambivalence about the test being named after her</a>, preferring to credit her friend Liz Wallace for adapting an idea first raised by Virginia Woolf in 1926.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bechdel test continues to draw attention from both academics and journalists. In 2014, Walt Hickey of fivethirtyeight.com <a href='http://calvinandhobbes.wikia.com/wiki/Calvinball'>gathered data from 1,615 Hollywood films</a> and found that while movies that pass the Bechdel test tend to have lower budgets than those that fail, they do no worse at the box office, whether measured by gross receipts or by profits. <a href='http://www.brianckeegan.com/2014/04/the-need-for-openness-in-data-journalism/'>A follow-up study</a> by Brian Keegan extended Hickey's work, finding that films that pass the test get higher revenues, better ratings from critics, and slightly worse ratings from IMDb users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, the Bechdel test entered the news again, thanks to Smith's National Review article. Smith points out that the test returns some odd results: <em>Showgirls</em> passes, while all three <em>Lord of the Rings</em> movies fail. Given those counterintuitive results, Smith asks, is the Bechdel test even meaningful? Or is it merely a \"feminist Good Housekeeping Seal of approval\" with no purpose other than to beat political correctness into creators and viewers? He suggests the \"cowboy test\": does the movie have a cowboy? The cowboy test, he argues, is just as arbitrary and meaningless as the Bechdel test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smith's critics might suggest he has an axe to grind, but he makes a valid point. If the Bechdel test is important enough to influence decisions about what movies to make and what movies to see, then it is important enough to evaluate. Never mind whether the Bechdel test measures women's representation in Hollywood. Does the Bechdel test measure <strong>anything</strong>?\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the question I seek to answer here. Note that this question is much easier to answer - we don't need to make any assumptions about what the Bechdel test measures. One of the ways that researchers answer such a question is through <em>convergent validity</em> - how well the test correlates with other measures we are interested in. When the test score goes up, do other variables also go up, or down, or stay the same? The \"other variables\" in this case might include things like budgets, revenue, and ratings. Of course, we already have strong evidence for the convergent validity of the Bechdel test, thanks to the work of Hickey, Keegan, and others. But that might not be enough to satisfy skeptics. Sure, they might say, results of the Bechedel test correlate with these variables - but maybe results of the cowboy test would too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring a broad representative sample of movies on the newly-invented cowboy test would be difficult, but Smith doesn't really care about cowboys - his point is that the test is arbitrary and meaningless. Fortunately, it is easy to make a test that is certain to be meaningless - we can assign a random number 1 or 0 to each movie. That test is even stupider than the cowboy test - so stupid we could call it the \"stupid test.\" What can we say about the convergent validity of the stupid test?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kyle Smith thinks the Bechdel test is stupid. But is it as stupid as the stupid test?"

    "## The data\n",
    "\n",
    "I collected data from several websites, following the methods of Hickey and Keegan. I am extremely grateful to Brian Keegan to making all his scripts available - I was able to adapt them to do this study, which saved me literally weeks of work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie titles and Bechdel test information come from the <a href='http://bechdeltest.com/'>Bechdel Test Movie List</a> website, which collects user-submitted information about whether movies pass or fail the Bechdel test. Financial data come from <a href='http://www.the-numbers.com/'>The Numbers</a>, supplemented with data for a few titles from the <a href=\"http://omdbapi.com/\">Open Movie Database</a> (OMDb) and <a href='http://www.boxofficemojo.com/'>Box Office Mojo</a>. All figures were corrected for inflation to December 2016 levels using data from the <a href='https://www.bls.gov/cpi/'>Consumer Price Index</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "I adapted <a href='http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brianckeegan/Bechdel/blob/master/Bechdel_test.ipynb'>Keegan's published scripts</a> into Python 3 scripts that get titles and Bechdel test results from the Bechdel Test Movie List's API and match them to data web-scraped from The Numbers pages using the Python <a href='https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/'>BeautifulSoup</a> module. (Data from Box Office Mojo was added by hand, since their terms of service ask users not to scrape their pages.) The Stupid test was implemented by generating a random-number-based pass or fail with the same probability of passing as the Bechdel test."

Because it's a three-part test, so you could easily imagine scoring it: zero points if there are one or zero women, one point if there are 2+ but they don't talk to each other, two points if they talk about a man, and three points for a full pass. I'll consider that in an appendix here. But I think it's more in line with the original purpose of the test to consider it as a hard pass/fail.

If we accept that the Bechdel test is an accurate measure of the representation of women in movies (maybe it isn't, but it's the only game in town for quantiative research into this question), then this is a way of asking: has Hollywood's depiction of women in movies changed over the years? Of course, this change could be positive or negative, but we would hope and expect Bechdel test scores to increase with time.\n",

That's what the blue line in the graph below shows. The x-axis shows the year and the y-axis shows the percentage of US-made films released in that year that pass the Bechdel test. Error bars are standard error of the mean (stdev/n); note that they are larger in earlier years, when there are fewer movies in the dataset. The red line is explained below the graph."
