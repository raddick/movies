These are some notes from my own exploration of the topic. Maybe to be turned into a blog post or paper.\n",

If not, then there is some factor or factors that make the movies on the list different from all movies overall. One possibility is that people who submit movies to bechdeltest.com are more likely to notice and submit movies that pass the Bechdel test, so that the percentage of passes in our dataset is greater than the percentage of passes in all movies. Or it could go the other way - people are more likely to notice and report movies that fail.\n",

We can't either with the data we have now - but if we start with a complete list of movies from IMDb then join the bechdeltest.com list to it, we maybe can address this question.

The numbers in parentheses are measures of the degree to which the simple model matches the real-life data. The most important number is r<sup>2</sup>, which varies from 0 to 1. The standards for what r<sup>2</sup> value are \"good enough\" to draw conclusions vary by field and are up to the writer to propose and the reader to evaluate. In this research, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.46 probably counts as a weak effect. It's not compelling, but it's suggestive that Bechdel test scores probably are increasing slowly over time."

To do that, let's divide our data into two groups: those that fail the Bechdel test and those that pass. Then let's make a histogram that shows how many small-budget vs. big-budget movies are in each category. We don't make any assumptions about what a \"small\" or \"big budget\" is, let's just look at the data."
